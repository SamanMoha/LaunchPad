### Setup environment
If you don't have arduino
  1. download it here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
  2. If you use windows/OSx you will probably need drivers: https://www.wemos.cc/downloads
Start Arduino IDE


#### Setup the board

1. Open the Preferences window
2. In the Additional Board Manager URLs field, enter this URL : http://arduino.esp8266.com/versions/2.3.0/package_esp8266com_index.json
3. Open `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Boards Manager...`
4. Type `esp` and the `esp8266` platform will appear, install it
5. Select your board: `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Wemos D1 R2 & mini`


#### Add external libraries

1. Open `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries...`
2. Install `WiFiManager`
3. Install `Adafruit NeoPixel`

#### Scheme

1. Setup all the buttons on your board and link one side to the ground , the other to your board . If you are using the Wemos D1 mini , be careful , you can't plug your LED to the D0 Pin , so use it for your button , and the this PIN is an INPUT_PULLDOWN , so you have to link it to your alimentation using the resistor. If you do that , you can use all the buttons as INPUT_PULLUP .
2. Then link your LED (to the Pin D0 if your are on the Wemos D1 mini) and to the 5V output .
3. Now your board is setup :)
(nb : the D4 Pin is linked to the internal LED on the Wemos D1 mini , so when you will press this button the LED will light up)

### Modify the HTML

if you modify the html file, you should run the minify script to update the interfaceHTML.h

    ./minify.sh

INFORMATION: You need to install `html-minifier` before

    npm install html-minifier -g

## State of the art

The LaunchPad is a tool for music proposed by Novation (coast 150â‚¬)

## What we want to do

We encountered a small problem, so we only have one LED line.

The problem arises from the fact that the arduino does not emit enough voltage to combine more than a line of LED

## The interface role

The HTML interface allows the user to configure his launchPad. That means, the user can choose which LEDs to light according to each button. When choosing the LED, the user can also configure the color of the LED.

Currently we have encountered some problems concerning the interface, due to lack of time.

We were unable to properly transfer the desired data.

## Playing sound

The HTML interface also allows users to play diffenrent music tracks.
When you connect on an the launchPad interface a default music is played.
To light up your leds, you just have to click on keyboard controls 1 through 8.
By clicking on these keyboard controls you also change both leds colors and music displayed.
You only can read your music while the keyboard is down.
